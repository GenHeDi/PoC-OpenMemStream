# PoC-OpenMemStream
Proof of Concept using open MemStream in C

In my search for a solution to be able to read a text file of arbitrary size into memory, I came to the following concept.
It is not necessary to reserve a block of memory in advance. I haven't been able to figure out what exactly the open_memstream() function does in the background. If you do have that knowledge, I'd love to hear it.

I would like to give something back to the open source community, therefore this repository. My first ever GitHub repository.

In short, take advantage of it.
